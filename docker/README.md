# How to populate a local artifactory repository with layers from docker hub
## Purpose
Repeatedly downloading layers from docker hub to your local machine gets really old really fast.  It's slow and consumes 
bandwidth you might not have.  On the other hand keeping those layers around when they're not being actively used chews
up a lot of disk space.

If you have an artifactory server locally, these scripts will help a bit with that pain.  `pull-push-repo.sh` pulls 
images from docker hub onto your machine then pushes them to the artifactory server.  `localize-repo.sh` examines
images to determine what type of package manager that image uses and edits the configuration files to use your local
artifactory to provide the packages.

## Configuration
Since both scripts need the same sorts of information they share a common configuration file.  That file is hard-wired
to live in $HOME/.jfrog/docker.rc.  All of the tunables reside there.  The example configuration file in this registry 
directory is pretty well documented.

Any docker image must have a name that conforms to this pattern ([registry:port]/)([namespace]/)[repository]:[tag] 
e.g. artifactory:80/ubuntu:latest.  Namespace and registry are optional.  Both of these components must be 4 to 30
characters long consisting of only [a-z0-9-_].  The registry segment must contain a : or . to distinguish it from 
the namespace.  

flag | long             | parameter                 | description
---- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
-a   | --artifactory    | artifactoryRegistry       | Local docker registry
-r   | --remote         | repositoryName            | Remote image name on docker.io
-l   | --local          | destinationRepositoryName | Local image name
-p   | --prefix         | localPrefix               | Optional prefix to add to source image name to make destination 
-t   | --tag            | specificTag               | Specific tag to act on
-f   | --force          | forceUpdate               | Force the operation
-n   | --noupdate       | noUpdate                  | Do not perform the operation
-h   | --help           | help                      | Help

## Usage

Both programs take positional arguments or switches.  Positional would be (command) image tag registry, local name 
defaults to blank and prefix defaults to my.  So...
 
```shell
pull-push-repo ubuntu latest artifactory:80 
```
would pull the image ubuntu:latest and push it to 
artifactory:80/ubuntu:latest.  If you put artifactoryRegistry=artifactory:80 into your configuration file the
command would simplify to pull-push-repo ubuntu latest, or pull-push-repo ubuntu if you wanted all ubuntu images
to be transferred.

## Optional scripts
Scripts which execute after the Dockerfile is created, but before the build happens live in ~/.jfrog/docker.rc.d they 
must conform to $flavor*.sh where flavor is the repository flavor, ubuntu, debian, centos, fedora, suse.  A couple of 
example scripts are included here.

If you're running some of jfrog's other scripts which build various artifactory based docker containers you'll need
something like the local repository script to install artifactory since they require a yum repo.
